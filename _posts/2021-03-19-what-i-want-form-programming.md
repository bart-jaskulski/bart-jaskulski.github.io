Thought about starting a blog keeps me itching and bugging for some time, but I always procrastinated execution. I've been finding many reasons to do so, yet now I want to surpass them.

## 10 reasons why not to start a blog...

It's in fashion to create a appealing posts which puts something into quantified matter. That's just easier for us, humans to perceive something in limited scope, I think.
Then, play a game and list some reasons against writing personal blog.

### You certainly don't have a time

Who does actually, when we all are running for betterness (at work, in life). There's just not much time to sit down and write some thoughts. Oh, maybe there would be a minute or two to write a tutorial, but definitely not something demanding deeper thinking.

### You aren't good enough

There are many blogs around, yours wouldn't make a difference, so why bother? Especially when you don't have skills to write about technical stuff or something what could bring peoples' attention. Leave it to experts.

### You can't plan ahead

Seriously, event that posts comes straight from head, without any outline or at least slightest intention about conveyed message, just free-fall. I guess it is obvious, when looking at those short sentences.

### You don't speak yours voice

Everything you know is just someone's knowledge which you 'borrowed', and any idea you came up with is just another instance on the same matter, without freshness.

## Cut the bullshit

Those few points (not 10 apparently) may seem harsh, but imposter syndrome, flood of alike blogs and many various reasons can keep you (it keeps me) from writing and producing own content. Well, I guess I can't focus on my own gains, though I can list those too.
Some of great reasons for starting a blog would be:

* improving language skills (I'm not native in English)
* improving programming skills (after all, that's why I'm here)
* contribute to the community (who knows, maybe I will came up with some useful tutorial or thought about programming)
* have something to show in front of potential employer

### Fall for it

I think there's one message to myself (but not only myself): to fall freely into writing, especially when I feel, that's something not for me. It's great in many ways beyond that short post can cover and one day it may become something meaningful, at least to myself.

And stop comparing yourself to ones, who are now on top, it took them many years to get there and they definitely earned it. If you follow, you would too.

<small>Right now idea about writing a blog itches me even more with variety of posts ideas. We'll see, if I follow them.</small>
