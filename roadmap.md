# A bunch of things I'd like to add to the website

- [ ] Social links like github, etc.
- [ ] Page weight stat, inspired by [Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com) implemented in Ruby
- [ ] Issues link on each page I you'd like to correct me
- [ ] Page with my projects
- [ ] Better build process with github (atm I transpile CSS before commit)
- [ ] More appealing layout, but remember to keep it low
- [ ] Text proofreader as precommit script (I need to push my language quality)
- [ ] Real-time search (but when I will have more posts...)
- [ ] Add code highlighter (essential, I guess if I want to write something about programming)

## Opinionated constraints

- **No analytics** but if I change my mind somewhen, then make the dashboard public on this website.
- Keep single page low, not to exceed 1MB
- Prefer pure `HTML` and `CSS` solutions over `JS`
- Try not to use `media queries`, leverage new CSS functions like `clamp`, `min`, `max` and relative values
- Mobile first (duh), accessible first, maybe offline too
- Do not hotlink any resource, jsdelivr, unpkg etc. are great, but [prefer selfhosting](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
